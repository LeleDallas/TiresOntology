<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :cloud: Overview</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
This project revolves around the development of a standardized knowledge representation framework for tires. This project encompasses two files: an RDFS file and an OWL file, which serve as the foundation for the ontology. 
The ontology incorporates relevant information from the Automotive Ontology and the Environment Ontology, ensuring a comprehensive representation of tire-related concepts, relationships, and properties. By leveraging these existing ontologies, the Tires Ontology project promotes consistency and interoperability within the broader domain of automotive knowledge representation.

The primary goal is to enhance data integration, interoperability, and decision-making processes within the automotive industry. It enables efficient tire management, analysis, and collaboration among stakeholders, facilitating better understanding and utilization of tire-related information.

By establishing a standardized knowledge representation framework, the Tires Ontology provides a common language and structure for sharing tire-related knowledge and expertise. This enables the development of intelligent systems, applications, and tools that can effectively utilize tire data, leading to improved tire selection, maintenance, performance optimization, and overall operational efficiency.

In summary, it aims to enhance data integration, interoperability, and decision making in the automotive industry by providing a standardized and comprehensive knowledge representation framework for tires.
